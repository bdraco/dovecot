Upgrading Dovecot v2.1 to v2.2
==============================

v2.2 has a couple of changes to settings since v2.1:

 * doveadm_proxy_port setting renamed to doveadm_port (but the old exists still
   as an alias)
 * imapc_ssl_ca_dir and pop3c_ssl_ca_dir settings replaced by a common
   ssl_client_ca_dir

There are also some changes you should be aware of:

 * When creating home directories, the permissions are copied from the parent
   directory if it has setgid-bit set. For full details, see
   <SharedMailboxes.Permissions.txt>.
 * "doveadm auth" command was renamed to "doveadm auth test"
 * IMAP: ID command now advertises server name as Dovecot by default. It was
   already trivial to guess this from command replies.
 * LDA/LMTP: If saving a mail brings user from under quota to over quota, allow
   it based on quota_grace setting (default: 10% above quota limit).
 * pop3_lock_session=yes now uses a POP3-only dovecot-pop3-session.lock file
   instead of actually locking the mailbox (and causing IMAP/LDA/LMTP to wait
   for the POP3 session to close).
 * mail_shared_explicit_inbox setting's default switched to "no".

Downgrading can be done safely to v2.1.11 and newer. Older versions may think
the dovecot.index.cache files are corrupted and complain about "Invalid magic
in hole header".
